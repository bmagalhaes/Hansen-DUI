# Brief summary

Hansenâ€™s paper addresses a question regarding whether punishments and sanctions are effective in reducing drunk driving. He uses the theoretical result from Becker (1968), that suggests that criminals behave rationally when committing crimes by evaluating expected costs and benefits. The author analyzes administrative records from 1999 to 2007 from the state of Washington, where, during that time period, a blood alcohol content (BAC) above 0.08 was considered driving under the influence (DUI), while a BAC above 0.15 was considered an aggravated DUI. In order to evaluate the causal effect of having the 0.08 and 0.15 tresholds on recidivism, he examines other two mechanisms that, as well as deterrence, arise from theories of criminality and might affect recidivism: incapacitation and rehabilitation. 
The data is consisted of records on 512,964 DUI BAC tests, and restricts attention to individuals above the legal drinking age, since different cutoffs apply to those under 21. Given the characteristics of the BAC tests, the author argues that the inability of individuals to manipulate BAC allows for a quasi-experiment. Assuming that it is locally random for a drunk driver to have a BAC barely below or barely above the treshold , he uses the specific cutoffs to use a regression discontinuity design in order to test the effect of the punishments on recidivism.
Hansen finds evidence that having a BAC above the DUI threshold is associated with a 2 percentage point decrease in recidivism over the next four years, while having a BAC above the aggravated DUI treshhold is associated with one additional percentage point decrease in recidivism, which paper offers evidence of the causal effect of punishments and sanctions in reducing recidivism among drunk drivers.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
